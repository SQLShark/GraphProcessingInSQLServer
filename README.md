# Enhancing Relational Models with SQL Server 2017
Hello. This is the repo for all the content relating to my session "Enhancing the relational model with graph processing in SQL Server 2017". If you have attend this session before then you have my thanks. If you have any questions, or you need support. Please let me know.  

# Today's Abstract
Analysing highly connected data using SQL is hard! Relational databases were simply not designed to handle this, but graph databases are. Built from the ground up to understand highly connected data, graph databases enable a flexible performant way to analyse relationships, and one has just landed in SQL Server 2017! SQL Server supports two new table types NODE and EDGE and a new function MATCH, which enables deeper exploration of the relationships in your data than ever before.

In this session, we seek to explore, what is a graph database, why you should be interested, what query patterns does they solve and how does SQL Server compare with competitors. We will explore each of these based on real data shredded from IMDB.
